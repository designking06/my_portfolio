  description: The founders came to us with the idea of starting a record company, and asked if we could let them know what they needed to get the ball rolling and help them build the foundation of their company into a brand. We started off by developing a business plan, branding strategy and marketing strategy, going through a couple of revisions to make sure everything was sound and consistent. We then used their purpose, vision and target market to develop their logo and brand presentation. Following that, we proceeded to create graphics, develop their services and establish a social media presence with some advertising strategies.

  description: We have been in business with Lux Jewels since 2018. It started off with web development, but after some consulting, we came to the realization that their branding, marketing and operations could be more efficient. Not only did we create the website and provide product photography, we also worked with them to develop a more resonant brand, an inventory system, packaging, new products, and a social media presence.
